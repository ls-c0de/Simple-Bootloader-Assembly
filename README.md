This repository was the first one where i tried out the git checkout feature.
I had the problem that i wanted to try out new code, while simultaneously wanting to keep the old working code for lookup and reference in case of errors. 

The reason i started assembly was that i wanted to get to know Assembly to further understand the common principles behind coding languages, and also to get to know the basic principle of any modern computer.

## learnings
- Even a simple BIOS (atleast in real-mode) can handle pretty much all of the basic IO, for example keyboard inputs etc. using Interrupt Codes
- AX, BX, CX and DX are standard 16 bit registers, while AL (0) stands for the lower 8 bits and AH (1) stands for the higher 8 bits 1111111100000000
